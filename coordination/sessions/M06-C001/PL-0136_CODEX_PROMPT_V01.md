Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M06-C001/PL-0136_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V01.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M06-C001/PL-0136_CODEX_LOG_V01.md

## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M06-BATCH-001 / READY / CODEX`. M03–M05 remain accepted. PL-0068 remains OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audit artifacts. Never start M07.

M06 hosts existing M05 Windows services; do not duplicate ingest, validation, quarantine, raw-store, receiver or transfer logic.

## Mandatory implementation

1. Implement primary navigation for Library, Capture Inbox, Reconstruction, Editor and Settings inside one main window.
2. Use stable route/view IDs and a central navigation controller/router; do not create five unrelated top-level windows.
3. Capture Inbox must compose the accepted M05 IngestController/receiver/import results rather than duplicating ingest logic.
4. Navigation must preserve current project context and selected route deterministically.
5. Add tests for all route transitions, unknown-route failure, current-route state and Capture Inbox service composition.

## Validation

Use PySide6 offscreen/headless tests where practical. Run focused tests, exact full locked suite, Ruff, mypy/static/project checks, compileall and `git diff --check`. Any dependency change must update pyproject.toml and uv.lock reproducibly. Create one implementation/evidence commit and a separate log-only commit. User-facing repository links must be full GitHub URLs.

End exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`
