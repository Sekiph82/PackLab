## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M04-BATCH-001` / `READY` / `CODEX`. M03 must remain accepted. PL-0068 must remain unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audit artifacts. Never start M05.

Use the existing M03 camera, ARTrackingService, MotionService, accepted-capture, session-storage and diagnostics contracts. Do not create parallel sensor/capture ownership.

## Mandatory implementation

1. Implement a deterministic sharpness metric suitable for high-resolution packaging stills, with normalization that is stable across supported image dimensions.
2. Define configurable ACCEPT/WARN/REJECT sharpness thresholds and document units/interpretation; do not hard-code unexplained magic numbers.
3. Add a calibration harness/fixture workflow that can tune thresholds from labeled packaging images later without changing the algorithm contract.
4. On Windows without physical iPhone captures, treat thresholds as provisional/test-calibrated only; do not claim owner/device calibration that did not occur.
5. Add positive/negative/boundary tests for sharp, mildly blurred and strongly blurred fixtures or deterministic synthetic equivalents.

## Evidence and validation

Add behavior-bearing tests for success, failure, unavailable-data and threshold/boundary cases. Run all relevant deterministic tests/project checks available on the host, `git diff --check`, protected-file checks, and privacy/signing review. Native iPhone/Xcode or physical calibration may be claimed only if actually executed.

Create a distinct implementation commit, then publish the child log in a separate log-only commit. User-facing repository links must be full GitHub URLs, never local filesystem paths.

End the log exactly:
