## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M04-BATCH-001` / `READY` / `CODEX`. M03 must remain accepted. PL-0068 must remain unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audit artifacts. Never start M05.

Use the existing M03 camera, ARTrackingService, MotionService, accepted-capture, session-storage and diagnostics contracts. Do not create parallel sensor/capture ownership.

## Mandatory implementation

1. Implement deterministic dark-pixel/shadow clipping analysis with configurable luminance and affected-area thresholds.
2. Distinguish intentionally dark background from object-region underexposure where possible using the framing/object-region signal available in the quality pipeline.
3. Expose raw metrics plus explainable warning/reject reasons.
4. Do not invent physically calibrated thresholds without labeled owner/device evidence; keep them configurable and fixture-tested.
5. Add tests for normal exposure, localized dark regions, broad underexposure and threshold boundaries.

## Evidence and validation

Add behavior-bearing tests for success, failure, unavailable-data and threshold/boundary cases. Run all relevant deterministic tests/project checks available on the host, `git diff --check`, protected-file checks, and privacy/signing review. Native iPhone/Xcode or physical calibration may be claimed only if actually executed.

Create a distinct implementation commit, then publish the child log in a separate log-only commit. User-facing repository links must be full GitHub URLs, never local filesystem paths.

End the log exactly:
