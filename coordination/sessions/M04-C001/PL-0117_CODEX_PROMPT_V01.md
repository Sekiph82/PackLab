## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M04-BATCH-001` / `READY` / `CODEX`. M03 remains accepted. PL-0068 remains unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M05.

Reuse the shared M04 quality/coverage engine and the accepted M03 capture/session architecture. Presets and modes configure authoritative shared policies; they must not fork new capture/sensor pipelines.

## Mandatory implementation

1. Create a SwiftUI capture-protocol screen that explains lighting, matte/simple background, reflections, object preparation, working distance and handling rules for the selected preset.
2. Drive content from versioned preset/protocol data rather than hard-coded duplicated screens.
3. Require critical preparation acknowledgement only where the preset policy requires it, such as transparent packaging.
4. Keep instructions accessible offline and available before/during a scan without interrupting session integrity.
5. Add view-model/content tests for each preset and acknowledgement-required states.

## Validation

Add behavior-bearing tests for preset/mode policy, persistence, warnings/blockers and exact boundaries. Run all relevant regression/project/static checks, `git diff --check`, protected-file and privacy/signing checks. Do not claim physical packaging/iPhone validation unless actually executed.

Create a distinct implementation commit and separate log-only commit. User-facing repository links must be full GitHub URLs.

End the log exactly:
