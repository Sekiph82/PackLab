# PL-0115 — Codex Implementation Log V02

- Prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M04-C001/PL-0115_CODEX_PROMPT_V02.md
- Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M04-C001/PL-0115_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V02.md
- Previous audit: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M04-C001/PL-0115_CHATGPT_AUDIT_V01.md
- Starting commit: `bbb0743f792337e93440fe1c84131ba48e47bfa0`
- Implementation commit: `c971e946c039b6c58d94ee9b98091d1af331faac`

## Synchronization and authorization

- Fetched and verified `origin/main` before the batch, including required ancestor `0b7245863bb9eed135e8cb428c71afd14057306c`.
- Confirmed live `TASKS.md` authorizes `M04-BATCH-002 / READY / CODEX`.
- Starting local HEAD matched `origin/main`; final implementation push was verified at the implementation commit.
- Read the V02 prompt, V02 criteria and V01 audit before editing.

## Work performed

- Made Closure/Cap’s selected preset configure the active ring policy, including an 8-sector closure requirement, and the closure detail-pass policy.
- Applied the preset’s tighter framing threshold to the live detail acceptance gate while retaining the selected rear main-wide lens rule in versioned preset data.
- Preserved shared quality/duplicate/coverage runtime ownership; no macro or unsupported optical capability was introduced.
- Added runtime tests for preset propagation, tight-frame rejection/acceptance, closure detail gating and persisted lens/ring policy.

## Files changed

- `apps/ios-capture/PackLabCapture/Services/M04CaptureEngine.swift`
- `apps/ios-capture/PackLabCapture/ContentView.swift`
- `apps/ios-capture/PackLabCaptureTests/PackLabCaptureTests.swift`
- `coordination/sessions/M04-C001/PL-0115_CODEX_LOG_V02.md` (this log, separate log-only commit)

## Validation

Commands:

```text
git diff --check
uv run --locked pytest -q -k "not test_timeout_stops_parent_and_spawned_child and not test_cancellation_stops_parent_and_spawned_child and not test_windows_liveness_query_is_non_destructive"
```

Expected: no whitespace errors and the bounded non-iOS regression suite passes. Actual: `git diff --check` passed; `163 passed, 4 skipped, 4 deselected, 1 warning`.

`swiftc` and `xcodebuild` are unavailable in this Windows environment, so native compile/device execution is unverified. No physical or reconstruction acceptance evidence is claimed. The excluded Windows subprocess tests remain unrelated existing environment-sensitive failures; no subprocess code was changed.

Negative/boundary coverage includes selected lens invariant, object fraction below/at the active closure threshold, accepted detail evidence, duplicate decision input, closure ring policy and context reopen.

## Scope, privacy and safety

`TASKS.md`, ChatGPT audit artifacts, accepted M03 behavior and PL-0068 were unchanged. PL-0111 was preserved. No M05 work, secrets, signing material, private scans, supplier files, caches or generated reconstruction intermediates were added.

## Handoff

Implementation and log-only commits are separate and published to `origin/main`. This is builder evidence only; independent audit and lifecycle updates remain with ChatGPT.
