## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M04-BATCH-001` / `READY` / `CODEX`. M03 remains accepted. PL-0068 remains unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M05.

Reuse the shared M04 quality/coverage engine and the accepted M03 capture/session architecture. Presets and modes configure authoritative shared policies; they must not fork new capture/sensor pipelines.

## Mandatory implementation

1. Define a versioned Matte/HDPE preset that configures quality thresholds, framing guidance, coverage density and lighting guidance without duplicating the core quality engine.
2. Favor stable exposure, broad diffuse lighting and standard coverage while retaining all hard safety/quality gates.
3. Persist the selected preset and effective policy values with the scan session so Windows analysis can reproduce the decision context.
4. Allow future tuning through configuration rather than source-code changes.
5. Add tests for preset loading, effective policy values, session persistence and fallback/default behavior.

## Validation

Add behavior-bearing tests for preset/mode policy, persistence, warnings/blockers and exact boundaries. Run all relevant regression/project/static checks, `git diff --check`, protected-file and privacy/signing checks. Do not claim physical packaging/iPhone validation unless actually executed.

Create a distinct implementation commit and separate log-only commit. User-facing repository links must be full GitHub URLs.

End the log exactly:
