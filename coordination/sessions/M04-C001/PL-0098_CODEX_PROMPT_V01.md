Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M04-C001/PL-0098_CODEX_LOG_V01.md

## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M04-BATCH-001` / `READY` / `CODEX`. M03 must remain accepted. PL-0068 must remain unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audit artifacts. Never start M05.

Use the existing M03 camera, ARTrackingService, MotionService, accepted-capture, session-storage and diagnostics contracts. Do not create parallel sensor/capture ownership.

## Mandatory implementation

1. Implement a deterministic object/framing score estimating how much of the image the package occupies and whether margins are usable for reconstruction.
2. Return explicit too-small, acceptable and too-large/cropped states rather than a single opaque score.
3. Keep the design compatible with later package segmentation/masking work without starting M08.
4. Expose framing metrics/reasons to the live capture UI and logging pipeline.
5. Add tests for small, centered-good, edge-touching/cropped and oversized cases.

## Evidence and validation

Add behavior-bearing tests for success, failure, unavailable-data and threshold/boundary cases. Run all relevant deterministic tests/project checks available on the host, `git diff --check`, protected-file checks, and privacy/signing review. Native iPhone/Xcode or physical calibration may be claimed only if actually executed.

Create a distinct implementation commit, then publish the child log in a separate log-only commit. User-facing repository links must be full GitHub URLs, never local filesystem paths.

End the log exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`
