## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M04-BATCH-001` / `READY` / `CODEX`. M03 remains accepted. PL-0068 remains unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M05.

Reuse the M03 camera, AR/motion, quality, storage and diagnostics architecture. Coverage and auto-capture must consume authoritative accepted-capture/pose state and must not create a second sensor or still-capture owner.

## Mandatory implementation

1. Implement deterministic near-duplicate detection using accepted pose/coverage and, where useful, lightweight visual similarity signals.
2. Define configurable angular/translation/similarity thresholds and explicit duplicate reason codes.
3. Never delete prior accepted source images automatically; reject/prevent only the new redundant candidate.
4. Ensure missing/stale pose evidence fails safely and does not incorrectly mark useful frames as duplicates.
5. Add tests for exact duplicates, useful parallax, same-angle different elevation, stale pose and threshold boundaries.

## Validation

Add deterministic behavior tests for normal, unavailable, failure and exact-boundary conditions. Run relevant regression/project/static checks, `git diff --check`, protected-file checks and privacy/signing review. Do not claim physical iPhone validation unless actually performed.

Create a distinct implementation commit, then a separate log-only commit. User-facing repository links must be full GitHub URLs.

End the log exactly:
