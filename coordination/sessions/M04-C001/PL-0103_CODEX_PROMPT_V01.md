Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M04-C001/PL-0103_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V01.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M04-C001/PL-0103_CODEX_LOG_V01.md

## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M04-BATCH-001` / `READY` / `CODEX`. M03 remains accepted. PL-0068 remains unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M05.

Reuse the M03 camera, AR/motion, quality, storage and diagnostics architecture. Coverage and auto-capture must consume authoritative accepted-capture/pose state and must not create a second sensor or still-capture owner.

## Mandatory implementation

1. Create a lightweight SwiftUI coverage visualization driven only by the authoritative PL-0102 coverage model.
2. Clearly distinguish captured, currently targeted/missing and unavailable sectors without inventing capture evidence.
3. Keep rendering independent from AR session ownership and avoid adding a second tracking pipeline.
4. Update live as accepted frames change, with accessible text/status fallback.
5. Add view-model/formatting tests for empty, partial, complete and unavailable coverage states.

## Validation

Add deterministic behavior tests for normal, unavailable, failure and exact-boundary conditions. Run relevant regression/project/static checks, `git diff --check`, protected-file checks and privacy/signing review. Do not claim physical iPhone validation unless actually performed.

Create a distinct implementation commit, then a separate log-only commit. User-facing repository links must be full GitHub URLs.

End the log exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`
