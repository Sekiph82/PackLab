## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M04-BATCH-001` / `READY` / `CODEX`. M03 remains accepted. PL-0068 remains unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M05.

Reuse the M03 camera, AR/motion, quality, storage and diagnostics architecture. Coverage and auto-capture must consume authoritative accepted-capture/pose state and must not create a second sensor or still-capture owner.

## Mandatory implementation

1. Define an optional bottom/base detail pass that is only marked required/available when physically feasible under the selected capture workflow.
2. Never fabricate bottom coverage when the object cannot safely be tilted/raised or the view is unavailable.
3. Use explicit pass metadata and the same quality/pose/session persistence pipeline.
4. Expose skip/unavailable reason codes separately from completed coverage.
5. Add tests for feasible completion, unavailable/skipped state, partial sectors and no-false-complete behavior.

## Validation

Add deterministic behavior tests for normal, unavailable, failure and exact-boundary conditions. Run relevant regression/project/static checks, `git diff --check`, protected-file checks and privacy/signing review. Do not claim physical iPhone validation unless actually performed.

Create a distinct implementation commit, then a separate log-only commit. User-facing repository links must be full GitHub URLs.

End the log exactly:
