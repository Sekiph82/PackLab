TASKS.md must authorize M04-BATCH-002 / READY / CODEX. Preserve accepted M03 and PL-0111. PL-0068 remains OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md/ChatGPT audits. Never start M05.

Preserve V01 model work and close the production guided-capture integration gap.

## Mandatory remediation
1. Change orbit coverage input from arbitrary raw PoseSample to authoritative accepted-capture pose evidence (PoseCaptureBinding/AcceptedCaptureRecord.poseBinding or an equivalent production-used typed seam).
2. Only `available` aligned normal-tracking pose evidence may create coverage; stale/unavailable/invalid bindings must remain explicit invalid observations.
3. Wire accepted capture completion into the one OrbitCoverageModel owned by the active guided-capture session.
4. Add tests for azimuth wrap, elevation min/max boundaries, stale/unavailable/invalid bindings, duplicate sector capture and deterministic totals.

Run integrated behavior tests plus relevant regression/static/project checks, git diff --check and protected/privacy checks. Create distinct implementation and log-only commits. User-facing links must be full GitHub URLs. End exactly `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`.
