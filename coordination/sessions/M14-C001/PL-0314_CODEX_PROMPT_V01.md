# PL-0314 - Codex Prompt V01

Task: **Add safe-margin/bleed metadata**
Milestone: **M14 - Labels, Materials & Rendering**
Cycle: **M14-C001**

## M14 non-negotiable authority rules

- Read live root TASKS.md, M13 final audit, M09 physical-validation deferral, ADR-0005, and the exact predecessor child prompt/criteria before implementation.
- Design Model/CAD source revisions and stable semantic component/feature IDs remain authority. Tessellation/pixels are never promoted to geometric authority.
- RELATIVE/reconstruction_units never silently becomes millimetres.
- mm_unverified may carry numerical millimetres only with explicit UNVERIFIED physical status; no print-fit, mold, manufacturing, regulatory, material-certification, or production-readiness claim is allowed.
- Do not mutate or replace accepted M13 source authority.
- No runtime network download, private evidence, secrets, ambient absolute path leakage, or unreviewed dependency.
- Root TASKS.md lifecycle is ChatGPT-owned; Codex must not edit it.
- Each child gets an implementation/evidence commit and a distinct log-only commit ending exactly READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT.
- M15+ is unauthorized.

## Required implementation

Add non-destructive safe-margin and bleed metadata to label dielines with explicit numerical-mm semantics only on the mm_unverified dieline path. These values are user/design intent, not printer/manufacturer certification.

## Required validation

Cover at minimum: zero/positive values; invalid/negative/non-finite rejection; inner safe boundary and outer bleed boundary; deterministic metadata; source dieline identity; disclaimer; no geometry-source mutation.

Run focused predecessor/regression tests, the locked full repository suite, changed-file Ruff/format, targeted mypy/compile checks where applicable, dependency/lockfile check, scope/privacy/security review, and remote publication verification. Stop on any real failure or authority ambiguity.

## Handoff

Publish the implementation/evidence commit, then publish `coordination/sessions/M14-C001/PL-0314_CODEX_LOG_V01.md` in a separate log-only commit. Record exact changed files, commands/results, limitations, final local/origin/GitHub parity, and stop at this child if any mandatory criterion cannot be proved.

End exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`
