Task: **Generate revolved Design Model for axisymmetric bottle/jar**

Branch: `main`

Criteria:

Required log:

## Authorization and synchronization

Live `TASKS.md` must authorize M11-C001 / PL-0241 through PL-0267 batch / READY / CODEX. Re-read the M11 master, M10 audit, M09 physical-validation deferral, repository rules and this criteria. Fetch/fast-forward only when clean/safe. Never reset, clean, rebase, force-push or overwrite unrelated owner work.

Mandatory pre-reads:
- https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M11-C001/PL-0245_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md
- https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M11-C001/PL-0252_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md

## Frozen scope

Generate a Design Model revolve operation from an accepted axisymmetric strategy, fitted vertical profile and feature zones. Bind exact Scan Master parent and all fitting evidence. Produce parametric graph plus derived preview only through the existing preview seam. Preserve inherited unit state and deferred physical validation; no CAD/BREP or manufacturing claim.

## Authority rules

- Pin one exact Scan Master parent via the accepted M10 binding seam.
- Design Model parametric truth is separate from Scan Master and preview triangles.
- `METRIC_UNVERIFIED`/ `mm_unverified` remains unverified while PL-0220–0224 are deferred.
- No manufacturing/mold tolerance or CAD/BREP authority claim.
- M12+ and M13 CAD implementation are unauthorized.

## Required tests/evidence

At minimum cover: cylinder/bottle revolve, axis/profile validation, feature-zone linkage, deterministic graph identity, preview consistency, stale parent rejection, no CAD backend.

Run focused/predecessor regressions, exact locked full pytest, changed-file Ruff/format, targeted mypy, compileall, `git diff --check`, protected scope, dependency/license/privacy/secrets/generated/binary and remote checks.

Publish implementation/evidence commit(s), then a separate child-log-only commit ending exactly `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`. If green continue directly to PL-0255 without intermediate audit. Stop only on real FAILED/BLOCKED/OWNER_REQUIRED/master stop.
