# PL-0247 - Codex Work Order V01

Task: **Implement undo/redo command model for parametric edits**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Cycle: M11-C001
Branch: `main`

Master prompt:
https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M11-C001/MASTER_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md

Criteria:

Required log:

## Authorization and synchronization

Live `TASKS.md` must authorize M11-C001 / ordered PL-0241 through PL-0267 batch / READY / CODEX. Re-read the M11 master prompt, accepted M10 audit, M09 physical-validation deferral, repository rules and this child criteria. Fetch/fast-forward only when safe and clean. Never reset, clean, rebase, force-push or overwrite unrelated owner work.

Mandatory pre-reads:
- https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/core/src/packlab_core/design_model_binding.py

## Frozen scope

Implement immutable command-based undo/redo for Design Model edits. Each command must declare expected model revision, targeted parameter/feature and before/after values; application creates a new revision. Undo/redo must be deterministic, bounded and never mutate history or Scan Master parents. Concurrent/stale commands fail closed.

## Authority and deferred-validation rules

- Design Model is a separate editable parametric authority and never rewrites Scan Master.
- It pins an exact Scan Master parent/revision.
- PL-0220 through PL-0224 remain `DEFERRED_OWNER_VALIDATION`.
- `METRIC_UNVERIFIED` remains unverified; use `mm_unverified` where appropriate, never verified-mm/mold-ready claims.
- Preview/tessellated meshes are derived proxies, not parametric truth or Scan Master.
- M12+ and M13 CAD/BREP work are unauthorized.

## Required tests/evidence

At minimum cover: edit/undo/redo round-trip, multi-command history, redo invalidation after branch edit, stale expected revision, deleted feature target, deterministic command IDs, parent binding preserved.

Run focused/predecessor regressions, exact locked full pytest, changed-file Ruff/format, targeted mypy, compileall, `git diff --check`, protected-file/scope, dependency/license/privacy/secrets/generated/binary and remote-visibility checks.

Use separate implementation/evidence and child-log-only commits. Completed child log ends exactly `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`.

If green and no real stop condition exists, continue directly to PL-0248 under the master batch without waiting for intermediate ChatGPT audit. Stop only on FAILED/BLOCKED/OWNER_REQUIRED or master stop condition.
