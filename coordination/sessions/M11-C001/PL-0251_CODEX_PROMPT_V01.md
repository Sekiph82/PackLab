# PL-0251 - Codex Work Order V01

Task: **Extract robust vertical body profile from normalized Scan Master**

Branch: `main`

Criteria:

## Authorization and synchronization

Live `TASKS.md` must authorize M11-C001 / PL-0241 through PL-0267 batch / READY / CODEX. Re-read the M11 master, M10 audit, M09 physical-validation deferral, repository rules and this criteria. Fetch/fast-forward only when clean/safe. Never reset, clean, rebase, force-push or overwrite unrelated owner work.

Mandatory pre-reads:
- https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/core/src/packlab_core/scan_master.py
- https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/core/src/packlab_core/cross_section_overlay.py

## Frozen scope

Extract a robust vertical body profile from one selected normalized Scan Master using explicit canonical axis/front context and bounded section sampling. Preserve observed evidence, outlier/rejection records and coverage gaps. Do not invent missing surfaces or smooth transitions in this child; output is profile evidence for fitting.

## Authority rules

- Pin one exact Scan Master parent via the accepted M10 binding seam.
- Design Model parametric truth is separate from Scan Master and preview triangles.
- `METRIC_UNVERIFIED`/ `mm_unverified` remains unverified while PL-0220–0224 are deferred.
- No manufacturing/mold tolerance or CAD/BREP authority claim.
- M12+ and M13 CAD implementation are unauthorized.

## Required tests/evidence

At minimum cover: cylindrical/bottle synthetic profile, sparse/missing zones, bounded outliers, deterministic vertical ordering, parent revision binding, unit/deferred status, no fabricated closure.

Run focused/predecessor regressions, exact locked full pytest, changed-file Ruff/format, targeted mypy, compileall, `git diff --check`, protected scope, dependency/license/privacy/secrets/generated/binary and remote checks.

Publish implementation/evidence commit(s), then a separate child-log-only commit ending exactly `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`. If green continue directly to PL-0252 without intermediate audit. Stop only on real FAILED/BLOCKED/OWNER_REQUIRED/master stop.
