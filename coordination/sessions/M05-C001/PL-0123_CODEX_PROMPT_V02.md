# PL-0123 — Codex Remediation Work Order V02

Task: **PL-0123 — Production TLS/auth pairing and pinned iOS network client**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Master remediation: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M05-C001/MASTER_REMEDIATION_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md

Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M05-C001/PL-0123_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V02.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M05-C001/PL-0123_CODEX_LOG_V02.md

## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M05-BATCH-002 / READY / CODEX`. Preserve accepted PL-0127, PL-0129 and PL-0131, all accepted M03/M04 behavior, and PL-0068 OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audit artifacts. Never start M06.

Preserve useful V01 implementation. Close only the independent-audit gaps below, converging on one production finalized-package export/transfer/ingest architecture.

## Mandatory remediation

1. Preserve TLSIdentity, PairingAuthenticator and PinnedReceiverSessionDelegate; do not introduce custom cryptography or insecure fallback.
2. Expose a real HTTPS pairing/auth endpoint on the Windows receiver that exchanges a valid short-lived pairing offer/code for a scoped session credential.
3. Implement a production iOS URLSession transfer client that pins the paired receiver certificate fingerprint, performs the pairing/auth exchange, and sends authenticated protocol requests.
4. Reject wrong pin, missing auth, replay/expiry, wrong receiver and insecure/downgraded transport at the real network boundary.
5. Add ephemeral-certificate loopback integration tests for successful pairing/authenticated request, wrong pin, missing auth, expired/replayed offer and secret redaction.

## Validation

Add behavior-bearing tests at the production-used UI/network/receiver/ingest seam as applicable. Run focused tests, full locked suite, relevant Swift/static/project checks, Ruff/compileall, `git diff --check`, protected-file and privacy/secret/signing checks. Native/physical iPhone/AirDrop/real-LAN claims may be made only if genuinely executed.

Create one implementation/evidence commit and then one separate log-only commit. Every user-facing repository reference must be a full GitHub URL.

End exactly:
