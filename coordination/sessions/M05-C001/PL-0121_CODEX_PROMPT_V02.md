# PL-0121 — Codex Remediation Work Order V02

Task: **PL-0121 — Complete cross-language Transfer Protocol V1 contract**

## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M05-BATCH-002 / READY / CODEX`. Preserve accepted PL-0127, PL-0129 and PL-0131, all accepted M03/M04 behavior, and PL-0068 OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audit artifacts. Never start M06.

Preserve useful V01 implementation. Close only the independent-audit gaps below, converging on one production finalized-package export/transfer/ingest architecture.

## Mandatory remediation

1. Preserve the existing protocol name/version/create/chunk fields and HTTPS-only contract.
2. Define matching Swift and Python wire models for status/query, cancellation/resume, completion acknowledgement and stable error response envelopes.
3. Define idempotent retry/resume semantics explicitly in the shared protocol contract, including authoritative confirmed offset and duplicate request behavior.
4. Create authoritative golden fixtures consumed by both Swift and Python tests for create, chunk, status, cancel/resume, completion and errors, including version rejection and stable error-code mapping.

## Validation

Add behavior-bearing tests at the production-used UI/network/receiver/ingest seam as applicable. Run focused tests, full locked suite, relevant Swift/static/project checks, Ruff/compileall, `git diff --check`, protected-file and privacy/secret/signing checks. Native/physical iPhone/AirDrop/real-LAN claims may be made only if genuinely executed.

Create one implementation/evidence commit and then one separate log-only commit. Every user-facing repository reference must be a full GitHub URL.
