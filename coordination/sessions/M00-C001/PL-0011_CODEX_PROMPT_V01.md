Task: **PL-0011 - Validate the canonical session workflow**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Master: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M00-C001/MASTER_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md
Prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M00-C001/PL-0011_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md
Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M00-C001/PL-0011_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V01.md
Log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M00-C001/PL-0011_CODEX_LOG_V01.md

Read https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/TASKS.md, https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/AGENTS.md, https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/MILESTONE_BATCH_PROTOCOL.md and https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/AUDIT_POLICY.md. TASKS.md must still authorize M00-BATCH-001 / CODEX. Never edit TASKS.md.

## Objective
Create https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/SESSION_WORKFLOW_VALIDATION.md.

## Mandatory content
1. Validate TASKS.md -> frozen prompt/criteria -> Codex implementation/log -> ChatGPT audit -> ChatGPT TASKS.md update using existing repository evidence.
2. Use completed PL-0001..PL-0005 cycles as historical evidence and describe PL-0006 history accurately.
3. Document milestone-batch as execution batching only, not acceptance batching.
4. Show Codex cannot edit TASKS.md or self-audit.
5. Show ChatGPT is sole lifecycle/closure writer.
6. Show CHANGES_REQUIRED preserves task identity and evidence history.
7. Show batch stop conditions prevent silent skipping.
8. Define expected artifact naming and full GitHub-link handoff behavior.
9. Record limitations when local runtime commands cannot be independently rerun.
10. Do not create a second current-task tracker.

## Validation and scope
Run and record `git diff --check`, `git diff -- TASKS.md`, `git status --short --branch`, explicit checks for every requirement, exact changed-file review, protected-file review and privacy/security review.
Review the new file with `git add -N coordination/SESSION_WORKFLOW_VALIDATION.md` plus `git diff -- coordination/SESSION_WORKFLOW_VALIDATION.md`, or equivalent staged review.
Do not start the next child until this child is validation-green and its log is pushed. Do not start M01. Stop the whole batch on blocker, authorization mismatch, unsafe divergence, privacy risk or ADR_REQUIRED.

## Log
Create https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M00-C001/PL-0011_CODEX_LOG_V01.md. Record full prompt/criteria URLs, child start, implementation/evidence commit, files read/changed, validations with expected/failure/actual results, failures/fixes, scope/privacy checks, push evidence and limitations. End `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`. Do not self-audit or predeclare the future log commit SHA.
