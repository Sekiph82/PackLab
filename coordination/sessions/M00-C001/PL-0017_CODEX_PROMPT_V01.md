# PL-0017 - Codex Child Work Order V01
Task: **PL-0017 - Add protocol for blocked tasks and dependency escalation without silently skipping work**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Master: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M00-C001/MASTER_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md
Prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M00-C001/PL-0017_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md
Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M00-C001/PL-0017_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V01.md
Log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M00-C001/PL-0017_CODEX_LOG_V01.md

Read https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/TASKS.md, https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/AGENTS.md, https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/MILESTONE_BATCH_PROTOCOL.md and https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/AUDIT_POLICY.md. TASKS.md must still authorize M00-BATCH-001 / CODEX. Never edit TASKS.md.

## Objective
Create https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/BLOCKED_TASK_PROTOCOL.md.

## Mandatory content
1. Define BLOCKED as evidence-based state with exact missing dependency, input, environment or decision.
2. Require TASKS.md to retain the blocked task as frontier unless owner/audited dependency-safe reprioritization occurs.
3. Require Required Actor and concrete unblock action.
4. Forbid silently marking blocked work complete.
5. Forbid silently skipping to later dependent tasks.
6. Distinguish BLOCKED from CHANGES_REQUIRED and OWNER_REQUIRED.
7. Include PackLab-relevant external tool/device/account/signing/dependency examples.
8. Define milestone-batch behavior: stop the batch at a blocked child.
9. Preserve partial evidence without treating it as acceptance.
10. Require re-entry to the same task after unblock unless owner/audited plan changes priority.

## Validation and scope
Run and record `git diff --check`, `git diff -- TASKS.md`, `git status --short --branch`, explicit checks for every requirement, exact changed-file review, protected-file review and privacy/security review.
Review the new file with `git add -N coordination/BLOCKED_TASK_PROTOCOL.md` plus `git diff -- coordination/BLOCKED_TASK_PROTOCOL.md`, or equivalent staged review.
Do not start the next child until this child is validation-green and its log is pushed. Do not start M01. Stop the whole batch on blocker, authorization mismatch, unsafe divergence, privacy risk or ADR_REQUIRED.

## Log
Create https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M00-C001/PL-0017_CODEX_LOG_V01.md. Record full prompt/criteria URLs, child start, implementation/evidence commit, files read/changed, validations with expected/failure/actual results, failures/fixes, scope/privacy checks, push evidence and limitations. End `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`. Do not self-audit or predeclare the future log commit SHA.
