# PL-0063 — ChatGPT Strict Audit Criteria V01

Task: **PL-0063 — Scale estimation from known marker geometry**
Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0063_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md

All **18 criteria** are mandatory.

1. TASKS.md authorized M02-BATCH-001 / CODEX before material work.
2. Repository synchronization was safe and no destructive Git operation was used.
3. TASKS.md and ChatGPT audit artifacts were not edited by Codex.
4. No M03 or unrelated future-milestone work was started.
5. No secret/private Kenya scan/confidential supplier/signing/cache artifact entered public Git.
6. Actual changed files stay within the authorized child scope plus only justified minimal adjacent files.
7. Implement millimetre scale estimation from known marker geometry/observations with explicit mathematical convention is satisfied.
8. Use only accepted marker observations and propagate uncertainty/quality inputs rather than averaging blindly is satisfied.
9. Reject degenerate geometry, insufficient observations and inconsistent marker-size evidence is satisfied.
10. Return structured estimate/provenance including samples used and residual/error diagnostics is satisfied.
11. Add synthetic ground-truth tests covering exact, noisy, inconsistent and insufficient cases is satisfied.
12. Positive, negative and boundary evidence is meaningful and would detect a broken implementation.
13. Relevant accepted M00/M01 behavior and ownership boundaries remain unregressed.
14. Units, versions, coordinate conventions and provenance are explicit wherever dimensional/contract truth is involved.
15. git diff --check passes and builder TASKS.md diff is empty.
16. Platform/device/physical evidence boundaries are truthful and unavailable evidence is not fabricated.
17. The child log exists at https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0063_CODEX_LOG_V01.md, links prompt/criteria, records implementation evidence and ends READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT.
18. Actual GitHub source/diff/tests/log are mutually consistent and no material child defect remains.

## Closure

ChatGPT independently audits the actual GitHub implementation/evidence. Builder validation never self-closes this task.
