# PL-0063 — Codex Remediation Work Order V02

Task: **PL-0063 — Degenerate marker geometry rejection remediation**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Blocking audit: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0063_CHATGPT_AUDIT_V01.md
This prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0063_CODEX_PROMPT_V02.md
Frozen criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0063_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V02.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0063_CODEX_LOG_V02.md

## Authorization gate

Read TASKS.md, AGENTS.md, coordination/MILESTONE_BATCH_PROTOCOL.md, the original V01 prompt/criteria/log, the blocking audit above, this V02 prompt and its criteria.

TASKS.md must authorize `M02-RESUME-REMEDIATION-BATCH-001` / CODEX. Otherwise stop `TASK_STATE_MISMATCH`.

Before material work:
- `git fetch origin main --prune`
- `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main`
- `git status --porcelain`

Require safe synchronized state. Never reset/rebase/force-push/destructively clean/stash owner work. Never edit TASKS.md. Never start PL-0067/PL-0068 or M03 during this remediation batch.

## Authorized files

- `core/src/packlab_core/calibration/scale_estimation.py`
- `tests/calibration/test_scale_estimation.py`
- `docs/calibration/scale-estimation.md`

Minimal adjacent files are allowed only when technically necessary and must be justified in the log.

## Mandatory remediation requirements

1. Validate accepted marker corners as a simple non-degenerate quadrilateral before scale estimation.
2. Reject near-zero polygon area with a documented numerical tolerance.
3. Reject self-intersecting/bow-tie corner order.
4. Prefer requiring a convex ordered quadrilateral if that matches the frozen marker-corner convention, and document the exact rule.
5. Add synthetic tests for four collinear points, bow-tie/self-crossing points, near-zero area and a valid perspective-distorted convex quadrilateral.
6. Preserve weighted mm-per-pixel scale estimation, residual/provenance outputs and existing insufficient/inconsistent-observation handling.

## Validation

Re-run all still-valid original V01 requirements plus the focused remediation checks. Run relevant pytest, Ruff/mypy when Python is touched, `git diff --check`, `git diff -- TASKS.md`, exact changed-file review and privacy/secrets review.

Tests must be sensitivity-bearing against the exact pre-remediation defect. Do not substitute string-presence tests for semantic/geometry/binary/relationship behavior when the audit requires stronger proof.

Do not fabricate native Swift/Xcode/device/physical evidence.

## Handoff

Publish https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0063_CODEX_LOG_V02.md with synchronized start, implementation/evidence commit, exact files, defect mapping, focused negative/mutation evidence, full regressions, scope/privacy review, platform limitations and remote visibility.

End exactly `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`. Do not self-audit.
