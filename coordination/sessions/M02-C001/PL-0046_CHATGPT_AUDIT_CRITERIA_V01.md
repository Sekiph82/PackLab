# PL-0046 — ChatGPT Strict Audit Criteria V01

Task: **PL-0046 — Per-photo metadata schema**
Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0046_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md

All **18 criteria** are mandatory.

1. TASKS.md authorized M02-BATCH-001 / CODEX before material work.
2. Repository synchronization was safe and no destructive Git operation was used.
3. TASKS.md and ChatGPT audit artifacts were not edited by Codex.
4. No M03 or unrelated future-milestone work was started.
5. No secret/private Kenya scan/confidential supplier/signing/cache artifact entered public Git.
6. Actual changed files stay within the authorized child scope plus only justified minimal adjacent files.
7. Define per-photo metadata for filename, orientation, focal/exposure/ISO/white-balance data, pixel dimensions and capture sequence is satisfied.
8. Specify units, nullability/availability markers, numeric ranges and orientation conventions is satisfied.
9. Bind metadata entries deterministically to image payload paths and sequence order is satisfied.
10. Preserve original capture metadata semantics without inventing unavailable EXIF values is satisfied.
11. Add positive and negative fixtures for missing, malformed and unavailable metadata is satisfied.
12. Positive, negative and boundary evidence is meaningful and would detect a broken implementation.
13. Relevant accepted M00/M01 behavior and ownership boundaries remain unregressed.
14. Units, versions, coordinate conventions and provenance are explicit wherever dimensional/contract truth is involved.
15. git diff --check passes and builder TASKS.md diff is empty.
16. Platform/device/physical evidence boundaries are truthful and unavailable evidence is not fabricated.
17. The child log exists at https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0046_CODEX_LOG_V01.md, links prompt/criteria, records implementation evidence and ends READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT.
18. Actual GitHub source/diff/tests/log are mutually consistent and no material child defect remains.

## Closure

ChatGPT independently audits the actual GitHub implementation/evidence. Builder validation never self-closes this task.
