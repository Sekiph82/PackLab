# PL-0044 — Codex Remediation Work Order V02

Task: **PL-0044 — Deterministic ZIP timestamp contract remediation**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Blocking audit: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0044_CHATGPT_AUDIT_V01.md
This prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0044_CODEX_PROMPT_V02.md
Frozen criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0044_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V02.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0044_CODEX_LOG_V02.md

## Authorization

Read TASKS.md, AGENTS.md, coordination/MILESTONE_BATCH_PROTOCOL.md, the original V01 prompt/criteria/log, the blocking audit above, this V02 prompt and its criteria.

TASKS.md must authorize `M02-REMEDIATION-BATCH-001` / CODEX. Otherwise stop `TASK_STATE_MISMATCH`.

Before material work:
- `git fetch origin main --prune`
- `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main`
- `git status --porcelain`

Require safe synchronized state. Never reset/rebase/force-push/destructively clean/stash owner work. Never edit TASKS.md. Never start PL-0051 or M03 during this remediation batch.

## Authorized files

- `schemas/packscan/layout.json`
- `docs/packscan/container-layout.md`
- `tests/packscan/test_layout_contract.py`

Minimal adjacent files are allowed only when technically necessary and must be justified in the log.

## Mandatory remediation requirements

1. Freeze one exact valid canonical ZIP central-directory timestamp for every deterministic PackScan entry. Use a representation that both Python and Swift can implement; 1980-01-01 00:00:00 is acceptable.
2. Remove advisory language such as 'where the writer permits it'. Deterministic writers must apply the canonical value.
3. Define the treatment of timestamp-related ZIP extra fields so they cannot reintroduce platform-dependent timestamps; either omit them or freeze their contents explicitly.
4. Preserve the existing path, ordering, compression, authority and compatibility rules.
5. Add a machine-level regression that loads layout.json and proves the timestamp rule is exact, required and standards-valid for the Python ZIP boundary.

## Validation

Re-run all still-valid original task requirements plus the focused remediation checks. Run relevant pytest, Ruff/mypy when Python is touched, `git diff --check`, `git diff -- TASKS.md`, exact changed-file review and privacy/secrets review.

Tests must be sensitivity-bearing: where the blocking audit identified an ambiguity, add a negative/mutation case that would fail on the pre-remediation contract.

No native/device/physical evidence may be fabricated.

## Handoff

Publish https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0044_CODEX_LOG_V02.md. Record synchronized start, implementation/evidence commit, exact files, defect mapping, validation commands/results, failures/fixes, regressions, scope/privacy, platform limitations and push/remote evidence.

End exactly with `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`. Do not self-audit.
