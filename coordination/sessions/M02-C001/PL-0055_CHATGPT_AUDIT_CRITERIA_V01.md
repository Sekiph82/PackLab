# PL-0055 — ChatGPT Strict Audit Criteria V01

Task: **PL-0055 — PackScan validation fixture corpus**
Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0055_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md

All **18 criteria** are mandatory.

1. TASKS.md authorized M02-BATCH-001 / CODEX before material work.
2. Repository synchronization was safe and no destructive Git operation was used.
3. TASKS.md and ChatGPT audit artifacts were not edited by Codex.
4. No M03 or unrelated future-milestone work was started.
5. No secret/private Kenya scan/confidential supplier/signing/cache artifact entered public Git.
6. Actual changed files stay within the authorized child scope plus only justified minimal adjacent files.
7. Create safe public fixtures for valid, old-version, future-version, corrupt and incomplete PackScan samples is satisfied.
8. Fixtures must be tiny/synthetic and contain no private scans, owner identifiers or confidential assets is satisfied.
9. Document expected validation outcome and reason for every fixture is satisfied.
10. Ensure future-version and old-version behavior matches the frozen compatibility rules rather than being treated generically is satisfied.
11. Include fixture generation/provenance so the corpus is reproducible and reviewable is satisfied.
12. Positive, negative and boundary evidence is meaningful and would detect a broken implementation.
13. Relevant accepted M00/M01 behavior and ownership boundaries remain unregressed.
14. Units, versions, coordinate conventions and provenance are explicit wherever dimensional/contract truth is involved.
15. git diff --check passes and builder TASKS.md diff is empty.
16. Platform/device/physical evidence boundaries are truthful and unavailable evidence is not fabricated.
17. The child log exists at https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0055_CODEX_LOG_V01.md, links prompt/criteria, records implementation evidence and ends READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT.
18. Actual GitHub source/diff/tests/log are mutually consistent and no material child defect remains.

## Closure

ChatGPT independently audits the actual GitHub implementation/evidence. Builder validation never self-closes this task.
