# PL-0067 — ChatGPT Strict Audit Criteria V01

Task: **PL-0067 — Synthetic calibration ground-truth tests**
Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0067_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md

All **18 criteria** are mandatory.

1. TASKS.md authorized M02-BATCH-001 / CODEX before material work.
2. Repository synchronization was safe and no destructive Git operation was used.
3. TASKS.md and ChatGPT audit artifacts were not edited by Codex.
4. No M03 or unrelated future-milestone work was started.
5. No secret/private Kenya scan/confidential supplier/signing/cache artifact entered public Git.
6. Actual changed files stay within the authorized child scope plus only justified minimal adjacent files.
7. Build deterministic synthetic calibration cases with known marker geometry, camera/projective conditions and ground-truth dimensions is satisfied.
8. Exercise detection/scale/confidence/profile logic without relying on private images is satisfied.
9. Cover ideal, noisy, partial, degenerate and inconsistent cases with explicit expected error bounds is satisfied.
10. Ensure tests are sensitivity-bearing and fail when scale math, units or coordinate ordering are intentionally perturbed is satisfied.
11. Record synthetic-generation parameters/provenance for reproducibility is satisfied.
12. Positive, negative and boundary evidence is meaningful and would detect a broken implementation.
13. Relevant accepted M00/M01 behavior and ownership boundaries remain unregressed.
14. Units, versions, coordinate conventions and provenance are explicit wherever dimensional/contract truth is involved.
15. git diff --check passes and builder TASKS.md diff is empty.
16. Platform/device/physical evidence boundaries are truthful and unavailable evidence is not fabricated.
17. The child log exists at https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M02-C001/PL-0067_CODEX_LOG_V01.md, links prompt/criteria, records implementation evidence and ends READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT.
18. Actual GitHub source/diff/tests/log are mutually consistent and no material child defect remains.

## Closure

ChatGPT independently audits the actual GitHub implementation/evidence. Builder validation never self-closes this task.
