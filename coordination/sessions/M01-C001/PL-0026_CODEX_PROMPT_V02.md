## Authority

Root TASKS.md must authorize the M01 remediation batch and Required Actor CODEX. Read AGENTS.md, coordination/MILESTONE_BATCH_PROTOCOL.md, coordination/AUDIT_POLICY.md, the relevant V01 prompt/criteria/log/audit history, and current files before work.

Before material work run:
- git fetch origin main --prune
- git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main
- git status --porcelain

Require safe synchronized state. Never reset/rebase/force-push/destructively clean/stash owner work. Never edit TASKS.md.

## Authorized files

- `core/src/packlab_core/cache_paths.py`
- `tests/core/test_cache_paths.py`
- `docs/development/CACHE_POLICY.md`

Minimal adjacent files are allowed only when technically necessary for the remediation and must be justified in the log.

## Mandatory remediation requirements

1. Make Windows cache, temporary workspace, and durable project-data roots physically distinct so durable owner data is never beneath the logical cache root.
2. Prefer sibling cache/work/data roots or another clearly separated platform-appropriate arrangement.
3. Preserve macOS/Linux separation, explicit PACKLAB_CACHE_ROOT/PACKLAB_DATA_ROOT overrides, lazy creation and no automatic deletion.
4. Add Windows regression tests proving project_data_root is neither equal to nor a descendant of cache_root and that tests use temporary paths only.
5. Update documentation to match exact path semantics.

## Full regression

Re-run the original task's still-valid mandatory criteria, not only the named defect. Preserve all accepted behavior from sibling M01 tasks. Run task-relevant focused tests/checks, git diff --check, git diff -- TASKS.md, exact changed-file review, protected-file review and privacy/secrets review.

For Swift/Xcode tasks, static project/source evidence on Windows is allowed but native Xcode/simulator/device success must not be fabricated.

## Handoff

Create https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M01-C001/PL-0026_CODEX_LOG_V02.md. Record synchronized start, implementation/evidence commit, exact files changed, defect-to-fix mapping, validation expected/failure/actual results, regressions, privacy/scope review, platform limitations and push evidence.

End with `AWAITING_AUDIT`. Do not self-audit. Do not start M02.
