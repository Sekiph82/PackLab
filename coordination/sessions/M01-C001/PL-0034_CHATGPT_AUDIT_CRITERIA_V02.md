# PL-0034 — ChatGPT Strict Remediation Audit Criteria V02

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M01-C001/PL-0034_CODEX_PROMPT_V02.md
Prior audit evidence: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M01-C001/PL-0034_CHATGPT_AUDIT_V01.md

All **23 criteria** are mandatory.

1. Root TASKS.md authorized the M01 remediation batch / CODEX before material work.
2. Repository synchronization was safe and no destructive Git operation was used.
3. Root TASKS.md was not edited by Codex.
4. No M02 task or unrelated future product work was started.
5. No secret/private scan/confidential supplier/signing material/cache was committed.
6. Actual changed files are within the authorized remediation scope plus only justified minimal adjacent files.
7. The exact blocking finding in the referenced audit is actually corrected, not merely documented.
8. Separate NVIDIA driver/NVML discovery from CUDA runtime/toolkit capability truth is satisfied.
9. Do not mark CUDA AVAILABLE merely because nvidia-smi exists or returns a generic version is satisfied.
10. CUDA AVAILABLE must require direct evidence of the intended CUDA capability with explicit provenance; otherwise use UNKNOWN or UNAVAILABLE conservatively is satisfied.
11. Never infer CUDA from GPU name, memory, AdapterRAM, or generic version parsing is satisfied.
12. Preserve missing/probe-error isolation and the unselected Python OpenCascade binding is satisfied.
13. Add tests proving nvidia-smi alone does not establish CUDA, direct CUDA evidence can establish it, and malformed/missing probes stay conservative is satisfied.
14. Original task behavior not implicated by the defect remains intact.
15. Relevant sibling M01 regressions remain intact.
16. Focused tests/static checks are meaningful and would fail on the pre-remediation defect.
17. git diff --check passes and builder TASKS.md diff is empty.
18. Protected-file/privacy/security review passes.
19. Platform-specific evidence is truthful and unavailable native/device evidence is not fabricated.
20. Remediation log exists at https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M01-C001/PL-0034_CODEX_LOG_V02.md and links prompt/criteria/audit evidence.
21. Log records start/implementation evidence, files changed, defect mapping, validations, failures/fixes, regressions, scope/privacy, limitations and push evidence.
22. Log does not self-assign AUDITED_PASS or predeclare its future log commit SHA and ends AWAITING_AUDIT.
23. Actual GitHub diff/source/log are mutually consistent and no material task defect remains.

## Closure

ChatGPT independently re-audits the full task against this remediation criteria plus the still-applicable original criteria. A PASS may close this task for M01 only if no new material regression is found.
