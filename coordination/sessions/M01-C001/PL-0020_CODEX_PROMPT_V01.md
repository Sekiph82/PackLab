# PL-0020 — Codex Child Work Order V01

Task: **PL-0020 — Add root README with mission, architecture, quick-start and repository map**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Master: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M01-C001/MASTER_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md
Prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M01-C001/PL-0020_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md
Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M01-C001/PL-0020_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V01.md
Log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M01-C001/PL-0020_CODEX_LOG_V01.md

## Authority and synchronization

Read root TASKS.md, AGENTS.md, coordination/MILESTONE_BATCH_PROTOCOL.md, coordination/AUDIT_POLICY.md, relevant M00 architecture/governance documents, and all artifacts produced by earlier M01 children that this task depends on.

TASKS.md must still authorize `M01-BATCH-001` / `CODEX`.

Before material work run and record:
`git fetch origin main --prune`
`git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main`
`git status --porcelain`

Require safe synchronized state. Never reset/rebase/force-push/destructively clean/stash owner work.

## Authorized outputs

- `README.md`

Additional minimal adjacent files are allowed only when technically necessary to make the authorized output valid, and every such file must be justified in the log.

## Mandatory requirements

1. Describe PackLab mission and the iPhone Capture -> PackScan -> Windows Studio -> reconstruction -> Scan Master -> editable Design Model flow.
2. Include a concise architecture diagram and repository map consistent with REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md.
3. Provide current developer quick-start that is truthful for the present M01 state and does not claim later features exist.
4. Link canonical TASKS.md, governance docs, host/device baseline, versioning, dependency/license register and secrets policy.
5. State non-LiDAR iPhone 16 Standard baseline, Windows-first Studio, GitHub Actions macOS boundary, and Scan Mesh versus Design Model distinction.
6. Do not publish owner/private paths, secrets, private scans, supplier material or unsupported accuracy claims.

## Validation

Run all task-relevant focused tests/checks plus:
- `git diff --check`
- `git diff -- TASKS.md`
- exact changed-file review
- protected-file review
- privacy/secrets review
- relevant earlier-M01 regression checks.

For new files, use a diff/staged review that can actually see untracked content.

Platform-specific evidence must be truthful. Windows must not be represented as native Xcode/macOS. If a required validation is impossible without a future authorized platform, record the limitation and satisfy only the frozen criterion actually required here; never fabricate a pass.

## Boundaries

Do not edit TASKS.md. Do not self-audit. Do not create ChatGPT audit files. Do not start M02. Do not pull future PackScan/capture/reconstruction/CAD behavior into M01.

If this child cannot satisfy its frozen mandatory requirements safely, stop the entire M01 batch and publish the child/master stop evidence.

## Log and handoff

Create https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M01-C001/PL-0020_CODEX_LOG_V01.md with start commit, implementation/evidence commit, full prompt/criteria URLs, files read/changed, exact validation evidence, failures/fixes, scope/privacy review, platform limitations and remote visibility.

End the child log with `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`. Do not predeclare the future log commit SHA.
