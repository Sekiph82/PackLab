# PL-0028 — ChatGPT Strict Child Audit Criteria V01

Task: **PL-0028 — Create Python package/workspace layout for core and Windows Studio**
Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M01-C001/PL-0028_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md

All **20 criteria** are mandatory.

1. M01-BATCH-001 / CODEX authorization existed before material work.
2. Repository freshness/synchronization was checked and unsafe Git operations were not used.
3. Root TASKS.md was not edited by Codex.
4. No M02 task or future product behavior was pulled into this child.
5. No secret, credential, private scan, confidential supplier asset, personal signing identity, cache or unsafe generated artifact was committed.
6. Actual changed files are bounded to authorized outputs plus only technically necessary justified adjacent files.
7. Prior accepted M00 artifacts and earlier accepted M01 child outputs were not gratuitously rewritten.
8. Create a standards-based Python project layout that exposes reusable packlab_core separately from the Windows presentation package is satisfied.
9. Keep core importable without PySide6 and keep Studio presentation from owning domain contracts is satisfied.
10. Set requires-python consistently with PL-0027 is satisfied.
11. Define packaging/discovery in one canonical root pyproject without pulling heavy runtime dependencies ahead of PL-0029 is satisfied.
12. Ensure basic imports work from the intended developer environment is satisfied.
13. Task-relevant focused validation is present and meaningful rather than a no-op.
14. git diff --check passes and builder TASKS.md diff is empty.
15. Changed-file/protected-file/privacy review passes.
16. Platform-specific evidence is truthful; unavailable macOS/Xcode/device evidence is not fabricated.
17. Child log exists at https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M01-C001/PL-0028_CODEX_LOG_V01.md and links the full prompt/criteria URLs.
18. Child log records synchronized start, implementation/evidence commit, files changed, validations, failures/fixes, scope/privacy, limitations and push evidence.
19. Child log does not self-assign AUDITED_PASS, does not predeclare its future log SHA, and ends READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT.
20. Actual GitHub diff/source/log are mutually consistent and no material task defect remains.

## Closure

ChatGPT independently inspects the actual GitHub commit range, changed files, source/configuration semantics, child log, architecture, security/privacy, regressions and evidence quality. Builder-run local commands remain E1/E2 until independently reproduced or corroborated.

Any failed mandatory criterion keeps PL-0028 open. A child failure does not erase already accepted earlier child audits, but M01 remains open.
