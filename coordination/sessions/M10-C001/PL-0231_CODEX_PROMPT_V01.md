## Authorization and synchronization

Before material work, live `TASKS.md` must authorize M10-C001 / ordered PL-0225 through PL-0240 batch / READY / CODEX. Re-read the M10 master prompt, accepted M09 partial audit, owner deferral decision, repository rules and this child criteria. Fetch and fast-forward only when safe. Never reset, clean, rebase, force-push or overwrite unrelated owner work.

Mandatory pre-reads:
- https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/docs/implementation/PL-0233_SCAN_MASTER_AUTHORITY.md

## Frozen scope

Implement deterministic proxy decimation with explicit target policy and quality evidence. The full cleaned geometry remains the authoritative candidate reference; proxy outputs are authority_class PREVIEW_PROXY and must carry a back-reference to their exact full parent. Never replace or relabel a proxy as Scan Master. Preserve textures/UV references where supported or report unavailable truthfully.

## Deferred physical-validation rules

PL-0220 through PL-0224 remain deferred, not passed. M10 must preserve inherited scale state and provenance. A METRIC_UNVERIFIED parent stays unverified. No output may claim physical accuracy, mold readiness or manufacturing suitability merely because M10 geometry cleanup succeeds.

RAW_CAPTURE, reconstruction and original OBJECT_CAPTURE_GEOMETRY remain immutable. AI_VISUAL_REFERENCE/generated geometry cannot enter Scan Master ancestry.

## Required tests/evidence

At minimum cover: target triangle/point reduction, no-op threshold, proxy parent binding, deterministic identity, full parent byte/digest preservation, texture/UV limitation reporting, proxy authority rejection.

Run focused/predecessor regressions, exact locked full pytest, changed-file Ruff/format, targeted mypy, compileall, `git diff --check`, protected-file/scope, dependency/license/privacy/secrets/generated/binary and remote-visibility checks.

Use separate implementation/evidence and child-log-only commits. Completed child log ends exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`

If green and no real stop condition exists, continue directly to PL-0232 under the master batch without waiting for an intermediate ChatGPT audit. Stop only on FAILED/BLOCKED/OWNER_REQUIRED or master stop condition. M11 is unauthorized.
