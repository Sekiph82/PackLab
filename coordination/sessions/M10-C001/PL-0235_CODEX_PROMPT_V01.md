## Authorization and synchronization

Before material work, live `TASKS.md` must authorize M10-C001 / ordered PL-0225 through PL-0240 batch / READY / CODEX. Re-read the M10 master prompt, accepted M09 partial audit, owner deferral decision, repository rules and this child criteria. Fetch and fast-forward only when safe. Never reset, clean, rebase, force-push or overwrite unrelated owner work.

Mandatory pre-reads:
- https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/docs/implementation/PL-0233_SCAN_MASTER_AUTHORITY.md
- https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M09-C001/M09_PHYSICAL_VALIDATION_DEFERRAL_OWNER_DECISION_V01.md

## Frozen scope

Implement a deterministic deviation/heatmap service between a selected Scan Master revision and an explicitly supplied fitted Design Model geometry reference. M11 fitting itself is out of scope; use a narrow PackLab-owned comparison input contract and synthetic fixtures. Record signed/unsigned distance policy, sampling, thresholds, scale state, parents and color-bin metadata. If physical validation is deferred or scale is unverified, report geometry deviation in inherited units and do not label results manufacturing tolerance.

## Deferred physical-validation rules

PL-0220 through PL-0224 remain `DEFERRED_OWNER_VALIDATION`, not passed. Preserve inherited scale state and scale provenance. A METRIC_UNVERIFIED parent stays unverified. Scan Master authority is captured-geometry workflow authority, not proof of physical accuracy or mold suitability.

RAW_CAPTURE, reconstruction and original OBJECT_CAPTURE_GEOMETRY remain immutable. AI_VISUAL_REFERENCE/generated geometry cannot enter Scan Master ancestry.

## Required tests/evidence

At minimum cover: zero deviation, known offset, mixed positive/negative distances where supported, sampling/bin thresholds, stale parent rejection, deterministic output, mm_unverified labeling, no M11 implementation.

Run focused/predecessor regressions, exact locked full pytest, changed-file Ruff/format, targeted mypy, compileall, `git diff --check`, protected-file/scope, dependency/license/privacy/secrets/generated/binary and remote-visibility checks.

Use separate implementation/evidence and child-log-only commits. Completed child log ends exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`

If green and no real stop condition exists, continue directly to PL-0236 under the master batch without waiting for an intermediate ChatGPT audit.

Stop only on FAILED/BLOCKED/OWNER_REQUIRED or master stop condition. M11 is unauthorized.
