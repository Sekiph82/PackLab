## Authorization and synchronization

Before material work, live `TASKS.md` must authorize M10-C001 / ordered PL-0225 through PL-0240 batch / READY / CODEX. Re-read the M10 master prompt, accepted M09 partial audit, owner deferral decision, repository rules and this child criteria. Fetch and fast-forward only when safe. Never reset, clean, rebase, force-push or overwrite unrelated owner work.

Mandatory pre-reads:
- https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/docs/implementation/PL-0233_SCAN_MASTER_AUTHORITY.md

## Frozen scope

Implement deterministic comparison of Scan Master and fitted Design Model cross-sections at explicit canonical planes/heights. Produce presentation-ready overlay geometry/data while keeping authority in core services. Bind both parent revisions, units, plane selection and deviation summaries. Do not interpolate missing scan evidence into captured truth and do not start M11 fitting.

## Deferred physical-validation rules

PL-0220 through PL-0224 remain `DEFERRED_OWNER_VALIDATION`, not passed. Preserve inherited scale state and scale provenance. A METRIC_UNVERIFIED parent stays unverified. Scan Master authority is captured-geometry workflow authority, not proof of physical accuracy or mold suitability.

RAW_CAPTURE, reconstruction and original OBJECT_CAPTURE_GEOMETRY remain immutable. AI_VISUAL_REFERENCE/generated geometry cannot enter Scan Master ancestry.

## Required tests/evidence

At minimum cover: matching and offset synthetic profiles, explicit plane/height, empty/missing scan evidence, stale parent rejection, deterministic ordering, unit/state propagation, no fabricated closure.

Run focused/predecessor regressions, exact locked full pytest, changed-file Ruff/format, targeted mypy, compileall, `git diff --check`, protected-file/scope, dependency/license/privacy/secrets/generated/binary and remote-visibility checks.

Use separate implementation/evidence and child-log-only commits. Completed child log ends exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`

If green and no real stop condition exists, continue directly to PL-0237 under the master batch without waiting for an intermediate ChatGPT audit.

Stop only on FAILED/BLOCKED/OWNER_REQUIRED or master stop condition. M11 is unauthorized.
