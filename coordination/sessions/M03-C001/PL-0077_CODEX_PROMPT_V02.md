# PL-0077 — Codex Remediation Work Order V02

Task: **PL-0077 — Camera recovery integration remediation**

Master remediation batch: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/MASTER_REMEDIATION_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md

## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M03-BATCH-002` / READY / CODEX and point to the master remediation prompt. PL-0070 must remain accepted; PL-0068 must remain unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M04.

Read the previous implementation, prior prompt/criteria, and the independent audit. Preserve every accepted behavior and remediate every finding.

## Mandatory remediation

1. Wire actual AVFoundation/NextLevel permission, interruption, interruption-ended and runtime-error signals into one camera recovery owner.
2. Make observer/session registration idempotent across repeated SwiftUI lifecycle events and prevent duplicate sessions/listeners.
3. Integrate recovery with in-flight capture cancellation/failure and immutable accepted-capture preservation.
4. Expose recovery/permission messages through the capture view model/UI and add injected-event integration tests.

## Validation

Add behavior-bearing positive, negative and boundary tests for every repaired path. Run all relevant deterministic tests/project checks available, `git diff --check`, protected-file/TASKS checks, exact scope review and privacy/signing review. Xcode/iPhone results may be claimed only if genuinely executed.

Create a distinct remediation implementation commit, then publish the matching log in a log-only commit. The log must map every prior failed criterion to the fix/evidence and end exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`
