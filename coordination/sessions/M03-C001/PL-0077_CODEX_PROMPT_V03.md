# PL-0077 — Codex Remediation Work Order V03

Task: **PL-0077 — Camera recovery runtime wiring remediation**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Master batch: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/MASTER_REMEDIATION_CODEX_PROMPT_V02.md
Previous audit: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0077_CHATGPT_AUDIT_V02.md

Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0077_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V03.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0077_CODEX_LOG_V03.md

TASKS.md must authorize M03-BATCH-003 / READY / CODEX. PL-0070 remains accepted and PL-0068 remains OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M04.

Preserve every previously passing behavior and close every finding in the previous independent audit.

## Mandatory remediation
1. Actually register the still-capture in-flight cancellation hook with CameraRecoveryOwner so recovery cancels/fails pending capture safely.
2. Bind recovery onStateChange/user messages into the real capture view model/UI.
3. Forward preview authorization denied/restricted/authorized outcomes into the recovery owner instead of maintaining disconnected permission state.
4. On interruption-ended/recoverable runtime error, perform the real bounded session restart attempt and test success/failure/idempotent observer behavior.

Run focused behavior tests plus relevant M03 regression, project checks, git diff --check, protected-file and privacy/signing review. Native Xcode/iPhone results may be claimed only if actually executed.

Create a distinct implementation commit and a separate log-only commit. End the child log exactly:
