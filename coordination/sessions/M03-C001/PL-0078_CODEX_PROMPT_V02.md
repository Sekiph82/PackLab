## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M03-BATCH-002` / READY / CODEX and point to the master remediation prompt. PL-0070 must remain accepted; PL-0068 must remain unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M04.

Read the previous implementation, prior prompt/criteria, and the independent audit. Preserve every accepted behavior and remediate every finding.

## Mandatory remediation

1. Add an injectable physical provider using ProcessInfo thermal state, filesystem available capacity and UIDevice battery state/level.
2. Preserve truthful simulator/unavailable readings and distinguish unavailable data from healthy measurements.
3. Evaluate device health before capture and periodically/dynamically during an active session without blocking the main actor.
4. Bind warning/hard-stop decisions to capture UI/session control and test provider mapping, preflight, live updates and hard-stop transitions.

## Validation

Add behavior-bearing positive, negative and boundary tests for every repaired path. Run all relevant deterministic tests/project checks available, `git diff --check`, protected-file/TASKS checks, exact scope review and privacy/signing review. Xcode/iPhone results may be claimed only if genuinely executed.

Create a distinct remediation implementation commit, then publish the matching log in a log-only commit. The log must map every prior failed criterion to the fix/evidence and end exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`
