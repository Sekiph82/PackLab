# PL-0073 — Codex Remediation Work Order V04

Task: **PL-0073 — Focus runtime binding/test closure**

Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0073_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V04.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0073_CODEX_LOG_V04.md

TASKS.md must authorize M03-BATCH-004 / READY / CODEX. PL-0070 remains accepted; PL-0068 remains OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audit artifacts. Never start M04.

Preserve all correct Batch-003 source. Fix only the remaining audit boundary.

## Mandatory remediation
1. Connect the physical focus adapter's observed state to CaptureRuntimeViewModel.updateControlState so the visible focus UI reflects focusing/continuous/locked/unavailable/failure.
2. Use the selected CameraDeviceConfigurationCoordinator in the production focus-control composition and reject any non-selected device.
3. Add injectable adapter/device-state tests for wrong-device rejection, adjustingFocus→stable observation, lock-before-stable rejection, lock-after-stable success and UI state propagation.
4. Preserve serialized device configuration and current selected-lens rules.

Tests may use injected Apple-framework drivers/fakes and conditional compilation so they are reviewable on GitHub even when Windows cannot execute Xcode. Do not claim native execution unless actually run.

Create one implementation commit and one log-only commit. End the log exactly:
