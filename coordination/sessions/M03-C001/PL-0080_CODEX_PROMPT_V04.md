# PL-0080 — Codex Remediation Work Order V04

Task: **PL-0080 — Accepted-still pose persistence closure**

Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0080_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V04.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0080_CODEX_LOG_V04.md

TASKS.md must authorize M03-BATCH-004 / READY / CODEX. PL-0070 remains accepted; PL-0068 remains OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M04.

Preserve Batch-003 progress and close only the remaining audit boundary.

## Mandatory remediation
1. Call the pose binder from the real accepted-still flow after capture and persist PoseCaptureBinding with the accepted photo/session evidence.
2. Use a capture-time monotonic timestamp sourced as close as possible to the actual photo event; if fallback wall-clock bridging is required, record which timestamp path was used and its alignment semantics.
3. Ensure stale/unavailable/invalid tracking yields explicit non-available pose evidence, not omission or invented pose.
4. Add integrated accepted-still→timestamp bridge→PoseBuffer→persisted binding tests including exact tolerance and out-of-order samples.

Use injected drivers/fakes where needed so Apple-framework behavior is testable in source even if Windows cannot execute Xcode. Run all available regression/static/project checks truthfully.

Create one implementation commit and one log-only commit ending:
