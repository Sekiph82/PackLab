# PL-0073 — Codex Remediation Work Order V02

Task: **PL-0073 — Focus control integration remediation**

## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M03-BATCH-002` / READY / CODEX and point to the master remediation prompt. PL-0070 must remain accepted; PL-0068 must remain unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M04.

Read the previous implementation, prior prompt/criteria, and the independent audit. Preserve every accepted behavior and remediate every finding.

## Mandatory remediation

1. Integrate focus control with the selected main rear camera and the single camera/session ownership path.
2. Implement a real guided autofocus/stabilization phase before optional lock instead of setting continuous autofocus and lock in one immediate operation.
3. Expose focusing/continuous/locked/unavailable/failure states through the capture view model/UI.
4. Serialize device configuration and add tests for integrated transitions, unsupported devices and lock timing.

## Validation

Add behavior-bearing positive, negative and boundary tests for every repaired path. Run all relevant deterministic tests/project checks available, `git diff --check`, protected-file/TASKS checks, exact scope review and privacy/signing review. Xcode/iPhone results may be claimed only if genuinely executed.

Create a distinct remediation implementation commit, then publish the matching log in a log-only commit. The log must map every prior failed criterion to the fix/evidence and end exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`
