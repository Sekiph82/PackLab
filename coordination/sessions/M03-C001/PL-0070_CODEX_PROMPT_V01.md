## Batch authorization gate

Read TASKS.md, AGENTS.md, coordination/MILESTONE_BATCH_PROTOCOL.md, the M03 master prompt/criteria, this child prompt/criteria, and relevant accepted M01/M02 contracts.

TASKS.md must authorize `M03-BATCH-001` / `READY` / `CODEX` and point to the M03 master prompt. PL-0068 must remain unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Otherwise stop `TASK_STATE_MISMATCH`.

Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audit artifacts. Never fabricate physical-device results. Do not start M04.

## Scope

Camera device discovery/selection policy, adapter tests, minimal UI/status plumbing.

## Mandatory requirements

1. Enumerate rear AVCaptureDevice candidates available to the app and classify them by position/device type without relying on localized device names.
2. Define a deterministic selector for the intended back main wide camera, preferring builtInWideAngleCamera and rejecting front/unsupported candidates.
3. Record a stable lens identity suitable for PackScan metadata and later calibration-profile lookup; do not silently substitute ultra-wide/telephoto.
4. Provide explicit unavailable/ambiguous results and simulator-safe behavior instead of fabricating an iPhone camera.
5. Keep selection policy independently testable with synthetic descriptors; do not start still-photo capture.

## Engineering constraints

- Reuse the existing SwiftUI app, Swift 6 strict-concurrency configuration, iOS 17 baseline, NextLevel 0.19.1 pin, service seams, diagnostics/privacy rules and PackScan contracts.
- Keep source-of-truth ownership explicit. Prefer small testable models/adapters over framework calls scattered across views.
- Preserve simulator-safe behavior. Simulator/public synthetic evidence must never be described as physical iPhone evidence.
- If a technically necessary adjacent change is required, keep it minimal and justify it in the child log.
- Do not implement later child features merely for convenience unless the dependency is a tiny non-user-visible seam explicitly documented in the log.

## Validation and handoff

Run all relevant validation available in the builder environment: focused deterministic tests, project/source membership checks, any supported Swift/static checks, xcodebuild only when Xcode/macOS is genuinely available, `git diff --check`, `git diff -- TASKS.md`, exact changed-file review, and privacy/secrets/signing review.

If xcodebuild or native iPhone execution is unavailable, report that truthfully; that limitation alone does not authorize fabricated evidence.

Commit the child implementation/evidence separately, publish https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0070_CODEX_LOG_V01.md, verify remote visibility, and end the child log exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`

Then continue to the next master-ordered child only if validations are green and no batch STOP condition exists.
