# PL-0086 — Codex Remediation Work Order V02

Task: **PL-0086 — Pose diagnostics contract remediation**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Master remediation batch: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/MASTER_REMEDIATION_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md

Frozen criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0086_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V02.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0086_CODEX_LOG_V02.md

## Authorization

TASKS.md must authorize `M03-BATCH-002` / READY / CODEX and point to the master remediation prompt. PL-0070 must remain accepted; PL-0068 must remain unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M04.

Read the previous implementation, prior prompt/criteria, and the independent audit. Preserve every accepted behavior and remediate every finding.

## Mandatory remediation

1. Freeze explicit units, timebase and coordinate/basis version fields suitable for Windows analysis and align them with accepted PackScan contracts.
2. Fail closed on wrong-size/non-finite pose and motion arrays and malformed diagnostic record fields.
3. Reuse the existing diagnostics privacy/redaction boundary for exported string/session context.
4. Add deterministic golden serialization plus exact record-limit/over-limit, malformed transform, malformed motion and redaction tests.

## Validation

Add behavior-bearing positive, negative and boundary tests for every repaired path. Run all relevant deterministic tests/project checks available, `git diff --check`, protected-file/TASKS checks, exact scope review and privacy/signing review. Xcode/iPhone results may be claimed only if genuinely executed.

Create a distinct remediation implementation commit, then publish the matching log in a log-only commit. The log must map every prior failed criterion to the fix/evidence and end exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`
