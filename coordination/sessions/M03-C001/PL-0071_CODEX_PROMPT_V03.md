# PL-0071 — Codex Remediation Work Order V03

Task: **PL-0071 — Selected-camera still capture remediation**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Master batch: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/MASTER_REMEDIATION_CODEX_PROMPT_V02.md
Previous audit: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0071_CHATGPT_AUDIT_V02.md
This prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0071_CODEX_PROMPT_V03.md
Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0071_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V03.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0071_CODEX_LOG_V03.md

TASKS.md must authorize M03-BATCH-003 / READY / CODEX. PL-0070 remains accepted and PL-0068 remains OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M04.

Preserve every previously passing behavior and close every finding in the previous independent audit.

## Mandatory remediation
1. Remove unscoped NextLevel.shared capture ownership from the still adapter and bind capture to the deterministic PL-0070 selected main-wide camera/session owner.
2. Implement session-stop/cancellation cleanup so any pending continuation/delegate completes exactly once and cannot leak across session restart.
3. Keep original full-resolution bytes/dimensions and preserve overlap/duplicate-callback rejection.
4. Test the real injected delegate/adapter seam for success, failure, duplicate callback, overlap, cancellation and session stop.

Run focused behavior tests plus relevant M03 regression, project checks, git diff --check, protected-file and privacy/signing review. Native Xcode/iPhone results may be claimed only if actually executed.

Create a distinct implementation commit and a separate log-only commit. End the child log exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`
