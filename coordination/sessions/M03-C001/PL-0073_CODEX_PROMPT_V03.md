# PL-0073 — Codex Remediation Work Order V03

Task: **PL-0073 — Focus selected-device/live-state remediation**

Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0073_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V03.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0073_CODEX_LOG_V03.md

TASKS.md must authorize M03-BATCH-003 / READY / CODEX. PL-0070 remains accepted and PL-0068 remains OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M04.

Preserve every previously passing behavior and close every finding in the previous independent audit.

## Mandatory remediation
1. Make the selected main-camera identity and shared CameraConfigurationCoordinator mandatory for the physical focus adapter path.
2. Reject arbitrary/non-selected AVCaptureDevice configuration.
3. Observe real autofocus/adjustingFocus stabilization before allowing lock and expose focusing/locked/unavailable/failure state through the real capture UI/view model.
4. Add tests for wrong-device rejection, stabilization-before-lock, serialized configuration and visible state transitions.

Run focused behavior tests plus relevant M03 regression, project checks, git diff --check, protected-file and privacy/signing review. Native Xcode/iPhone results may be claimed only if actually executed.

Create a distinct implementation commit and a separate log-only commit. End the child log exactly:
