# PL-0092 — Codex Remediation Work Order V03

Task: **PL-0092 — Authoritative finalization-history remediation**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Master batch: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/MASTER_REMEDIATION_CODEX_PROMPT_V02.md
Previous audit: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0092_CHATGPT_AUDIT_V02.md
This prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0092_CODEX_PROMPT_V03.md
Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0092_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V03.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0092_CODEX_LOG_V03.md

TASKS.md must authorize M03-BATCH-003 / READY / CODEX. PL-0070 remains accepted and PL-0068 remains OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M04.

Preserve every previously passing behavior and close every finding in the previous independent audit.

## Mandatory remediation
1. Make the real PL-0091 finalization workflow persist the authoritative finalization state/history artifact, or derive history directly from an equally authoritative finalization output.
2. Treat present-but-corrupt finalization state as degraded/corrupt rather than silently in_progress.
3. Keep the real SwiftUI history view preview-only and retain degraded entries.
4. Add tests for in_progress→finalized/exported transition, corrupt finalization record, corrupt metadata, missing preview and multi-session deterministic ordering.

Run focused behavior tests plus relevant M03 regression, project checks, git diff --check, protected-file and privacy/signing review. Native Xcode/iPhone results may be claimed only if actually executed.

Create a distinct implementation commit and a separate log-only commit. End the child log exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`
