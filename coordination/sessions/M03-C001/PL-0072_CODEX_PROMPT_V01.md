# PL-0072 — Codex Work Order V01

Task: **PL-0072 — Preserve original capture metadata without destructive resizing or social-media style processing.**

## Batch authorization gate

Read TASKS.md, AGENTS.md, coordination/MILESTONE_BATCH_PROTOCOL.md, the M03 master prompt/criteria, this child prompt/criteria, and relevant accepted M01/M02 contracts.

TASKS.md must authorize `M03-BATCH-001` / `READY` / `CODEX` and point to the M03 master prompt. PL-0068 must remain unchecked / OWNER_REQUIRED. Otherwise stop `TASK_STATE_MISMATCH`.

Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audit artifacts. Never fabricate physical-device results. Do not start M04.

## Scope

Captured-image persistence, metadata extraction/preservation, immutable source handling and tests.

## Mandatory requirements

1. Persist original still bytes with original pixel dimensions and orientation metadata intact; do not resize, crop, filter, watermark or social-media-process source images.
2. Extract/preserve available EXIF/TIFF/HEIF/JPEG metadata needed by PackLab while retaining unknown metadata when technically safe.
3. Separate immutable source evidence from any future preview/thumbnail derivative and give derivatives distinct paths/identities.
4. Detect and fail closed on byte/dimension mismatches or destructive transformations in the source path.
5. Add deterministic fixtures/tests proving source bytes/dimensions are preserved and derivative logic cannot overwrite the master.

## Engineering constraints

- Reuse the existing SwiftUI app, Swift 6 strict-concurrency configuration, iOS 17 baseline, NextLevel 0.19.1 pin, service seams, diagnostics/privacy rules and PackScan contracts.
- Keep source-of-truth ownership explicit. Prefer small testable models/adapters over framework calls scattered across views.
- Preserve simulator-safe behavior. Simulator/public synthetic evidence must never be described as physical iPhone evidence.
- If a technically necessary adjacent change is required, keep it minimal and justify it in the child log.
- Do not implement later child features merely for convenience unless the dependency is a tiny non-user-visible seam explicitly documented in the log.

## Validation and handoff

Run all relevant validation available in the builder environment: focused deterministic tests, project/source membership checks, any supported Swift/static checks, xcodebuild only when Xcode/macOS is genuinely available, `git diff --check`, `git diff -- TASKS.md`, exact changed-file review, and privacy/secrets/signing review.

If xcodebuild or native iPhone execution is unavailable, report that truthfully; that limitation alone does not authorize fabricated evidence.

Commit the child implementation/evidence separately, publish https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0072_CODEX_LOG_V01.md, verify remote visibility, and end the child log exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`

Then continue to the next master-ordered child only if validations are green and no batch STOP condition exists.
