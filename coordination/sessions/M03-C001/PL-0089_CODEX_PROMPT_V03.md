# PL-0089 — Codex Remediation Work Order V03

Task: **PL-0089 — Gallery control/state remediation**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Master batch: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/MASTER_REMEDIATION_CODEX_PROMPT_V02.md
Previous audit: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0089_CHATGPT_AUDIT_V02.md
This prompt: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0089_CODEX_PROMPT_V03.md
Criteria: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0089_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V03.md
Required log: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M03-C001/PL-0089_CODEX_LOG_V03.md

TASKS.md must authorize M03-BATCH-003 / READY / CODEX. PL-0070 remains accepted and PL-0068 remains OWNER_REQUIRED. Never edit TASKS.md or ChatGPT audits. Never start M04.

Preserve every previously passing behavior and close every finding in the previous independent audit.

## Mandatory remediation
1. Use the canonical PL-0088 per-photo record contract consistently when loading and writing gallery records.
2. Add real delete and retake controls with confirmation/error states to AcceptedFrameGalleryView.
3. Make delete/retake atomically update persisted accepted IDs, sequence/replacement state and audit history together with file mutations.
4. Add tests for persisted ordering, delete, retake, missing preview, missing source, corrupt record and rollback/failure behavior.

Run focused behavior tests plus relevant M03 regression, project checks, git diff --check, protected-file and privacy/signing review. Native Xcode/iPhone results may be claimed only if actually executed.

Create a distinct implementation commit and a separate log-only commit. End the child log exactly:

`READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`
