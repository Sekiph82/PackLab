# PL-0286 - Codex Work Order V01

Task: **Implement front/back flexible-pack surfaces and seal-zone representation**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Cycle: M12-C001
Branch: `main`

## Authorization and synchronization

Live `TASKS.md` must authorize M12-C001 / PL-0268 through PL-0288 / READY / CODEX. Re-read M12 master, M11 audit, M09 physical deferral and this criteria. Synchronize safely; never reset/clean/rebase/force-push over owner work.

Mandatory pre-reads:

## Frozen scope

Implement deterministic editable front/back surface and perimeter/seal-zone representation for flexible packs, with stable feature IDs, artwork coordinate frame and explicit simplified geometry assumptions. Surfaces may be planar or bounded simplified bulge representations but must not imply measured film deformation. Preserve design-only authority.

## Authority rules

Exact captured Scan Master remains immutable where present. Design Model/assembly/library/flexible-pack authorities remain explicitly separated. `METRIC_UNVERIFIED` stays unverified. Flexible-pack geometry is design/visualization geometry, not mold-grade. No M13 CAD/BREP/STEP implementation. No private/raw data or unlicensed library asset may be silently imported.

## Required tests/evidence

At minimum cover: front/back surfaces, top/bottom/side seals, artwork coordinates, simple bulge optional path, invalid crossing/negative seal widths, deterministic preview, design-only limitation.

Run focused/predecessor regressions, exact locked full pytest, changed-file Ruff/format, targeted mypy, compileall, diff/scope/dependency/license/privacy/secrets/generated/binary/remote checks.

Use separate implementation/evidence and child-log-only commits. Completed log ends exactly `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`.

If green continue directly to PL-0287 under the M12 master batch without intermediate ChatGPT audit.

Stop only on real FAILED/BLOCKED/OWNER_REQUIRED/master stop.
