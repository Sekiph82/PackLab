# PL-0285 - Codex Work Order V01

Task: **Define simplified sachet/pouch Design Model**

Repository: https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab
Cycle: M12-C001
Branch: `main`

Master prompt:
https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M12-C001/MASTER_CODEX_PROMPT_V01.md

Criteria:
https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M12-C001/PL-0285_CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V01.md

Required log:
https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M12-C001/PL-0285_CODEX_LOG_V01.md

## Authorization and synchronization

Live `TASKS.md` must authorize M12-C001 / PL-0268 through PL-0288 / READY / CODEX. Re-read M12 master, M11 audit, M09 physical deferral and this criteria. Synchronize safely; never reset/clean/rebase/force-push over owner work.

Mandatory pre-reads:
- https://github.com/Sekiph82/PackLab/blob/main/core/src/packlab_core/design_model.py

## Frozen scope

Define a simplified sachet/pouch parametric Design Model focused on artwork surfaces, overall dimensions, seal zones and basic front/back shape. Explicitly classify this family as visualization/design geometry rather than mold-grade captured surface authority. No volumetric gusset/film mechanics or material simulation unless explicitly represented later.

## Authority rules

Exact captured Scan Master remains immutable where present. Design Model/assembly/library/flexible-pack authorities remain explicitly separated. `METRIC_UNVERIFIED` stays unverified. Flexible-pack geometry is design/visualization geometry, not mold-grade. No M13 CAD/BREP/STEP implementation. No private/raw data or unlicensed library asset may be silently imported.

## Required tests/evidence

At minimum cover: rectangular pouch/sachet, overall dimensions, seal-zone parameters, stable artwork surfaces, invalid seal/dimension relationships, deterministic graph, visualization-only authority flag.

Run focused/predecessor regressions, exact locked full pytest, changed-file Ruff/format, targeted mypy, compileall, diff/scope/dependency/license/privacy/secrets/generated/binary/remote checks.

Use separate implementation/evidence and child-log-only commits. Completed log ends exactly `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT`.

If green continue directly to PL-0286 under the M12 master batch without intermediate ChatGPT audit.

Stop only on real FAILED/BLOCKED/OWNER_REQUIRED/master stop.
